# Form Validation

### Data Validation: 
Its a process to ensure that the data entered by user is correct or not.
Example: 
- If asked for a name, user enters a numbers.
- Whether user has filled all required details or not.

> Using form validation, data is validated on the browser itself on the client-side before it is pushed to the database saving bandwidth.

### There are two types of validation:
- Server-side: Data is checked with database
- Client-side: Checking is done on the browser.
