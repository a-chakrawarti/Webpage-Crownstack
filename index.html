        <p>
            Obesity is a complex disease involving an excessive amount of body fat. Obesity isn't just a cosmetic
            concern. It is a medical problem that increases your risk of other diseases and health problems, such as
            heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and certain cancers.
        <ul>
            <li> There are many reasons why some people have difficulty avoiding obesity. Usually, obesity results from
                a
                combination of inherited factors, combined with the environment and personal diet and exercise choices.
            </li>
            <li>
                Obesity is approaching <mark>epidemic proportions</mark> in the US and many other industrialized
                countries. In the US the
                prevalence of obesity now exceeds 30% of the population and represents the highest rate of obesity
                worldwide. Since 1980 the prevalence of obesity in adults in the US has increased 2-fold. However, much
                more
                disturbing is the fact that in this same time period the rate of childhood and adolescent obesity
                increased
                3-fold.

    <h3>> Criteria for Designation of Weight and Health Status</h3>
    <p>The Table below associates a given BMI range with the risk for cardiovascular disease and <abbr
            title="buildup of fats, cholesterol etc in and on your artery walls which can restrict blood flow">atherosclerosis</abbr>.

        <br><br>Obesity is defined as a physical condition in which an individual has a <b>body mass index (BMI)</b>
        ≥30kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The BMI
        is a measure of the relationship between an individuals weight and height. The BMI is calculated by dividing a
        persons weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters.

        <h2 class="title" id="foodpyramid">> Food Pyramid and whats wrong with the model?</h2>
        <div class="w3-row-padding">
            <div class="w3-half">
                <p>The Food Guide Pyramid was introduced by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 1992
                    and it included six blocks. It was set up with a “base” of grains and carbohydrates (6–11 servings
                    of bread, rice, pasta, etc.), followed by the fruit (2–4 servings) and vegetables (3–5 servings)
                    group, then the dairy group (2–3 servings), and the protein group, including meat, eggs, nuts, and
                    beans (2–3 servings), and was topped off, of course, by the fats group at the peak of the pyramid.
                    <br><br>
                    The problem was the Food Guide Pyramid model’s success in encouraging Americans to make food choices
                    that prioritized consuming carbohydrates, which often resulted in diets dominated by excess
                    calories, sugar, and starches.
